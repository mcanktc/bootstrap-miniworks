# Login & Register Pages (Bootstrap)

This repository contains two simple and clean pages — a login page and a registration page — built using **Bootstrap 5** and plain **HTML/CSS**.

## ✨ Purpose

These pages were created as part of my **practice** while learning front-end development fundamentals. The focus was on building clean, responsive forms using Bootstrap's utility classes.

> ⚠️ All code in this project was written entirely by **me**, line by line, without the use of AI code generation tools.

## 🚀 What's Included

- `login.html` – A minimal login form using Bootstrap layout and components
- `register.html` – A simple registration form with proper Bootstrap form styling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5

## 📌 Notes

This project is part of my journey as a self-taught developer. It’s not meant to be a complete authentication system, but a small step toward mastering front-end basics.
